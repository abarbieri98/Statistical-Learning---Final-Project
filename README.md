# Statistical Learning - Final Project

The final project for the course was focused on the comparison between "unusual" clustering methods, namely model-based, grid-based and density-based.
For each family the most representative algorithm was chosen. 
The project was made by three people, the part in which I was most involved was the grid-based section and the CLIQUE algorithm, both in the theoretical and test parts.

The repository contains the following files:
- `Report`: pdf file containing the report of the project, with a theoretical overview of the algorithm and a test part on both synthetic and real data.
- `CLIQUE`: R file containing the tests performed

Links to the dataset used can be found in the footnotes of the report.
